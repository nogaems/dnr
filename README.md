.doc(x) name restorer

In case of using `testdisk`, `photorec` or any other file recovery tool, often filenames cannot be restored. Usually restored filename looks like "f0738328.docx" or similar. When there are too many files, it could become a real problem to find file you want. To make search a bit easier it is possible to take some text from the file and use it as the name. This could not solve the problem fully, but I think such solution is better than nothing.
